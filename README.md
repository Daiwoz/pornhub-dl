# Pornhub-dl

Download all videos of your favorite pornhub models, playlists and channels and update all your stuff with a simple command.

**ATTENTION**

This project has been archived.
I haven't used this project in ages and I just don't find the motivation to properly update, maintain or fix it. \
Feel free to start a new well-maintained fork for this project, I don't mind!

Still, I must say that this was an interesting side-project and I had quite a lot of fun polishing the scraping logic :D.

Shoutout to the people at Pornhub. I would really like to take a look at their IT infrastructure and streaming setup :wink:.

**ATTENTION**

**Further Disclaimer**

This project is not associated in any way with the operators of the official pornhub.com
It's just a small and fun side-project in reaction to
1. Possibly imminent media censorship in the EU through upload filters.
2. Free global premium in 2020.

## Setup

1. You will need `poetry` for dependency management and venv creation: `poetry install`
1. Run the program once with `poetry run python ./pornhub-dl`. This will create the configuration file `~/.config/pornhub_dl.toml`.
1. The default config will try to create a new postgres database `pornhub` when running the program for the first time after the config has been created.
If you want to change the database url, you need to adjust the sqluri in the configuration file.
Pornhub-dl might work with other database engines (_mysql_, _sqlite_), but this hasn't been tested.
Also make sure your user has proper database rights.

1. If you want to be up to date with migrations, set the alembic head to your current version.
This is done by by running `poetry run alembic stamp head`.

## Migrating

Just execute `poetry run alembic upgrade head`.

## Usage

The project is used by invocing `pornhub-dl`. In combination with poetry this looks like this: `poetry run python pornhub-dl`  

There is a help for all commands, but here are some examples anyway:

- `pornhub-dl user [some_model]` Follow this user/model/pornstar and download all videos.
- `pornhub-dl playlist [playlist_id]` Follow this playlist and download all videos.
- `pornhub-dl channel [channel_id]` Follow this channel and download all videos.
- `pornhub-dl video [vkey]` Download a single video by viewkey e.g. `ph56e961d32ce26`
- `pornhub-dl update` Get the newest videos of all your followed models, playlists and channels.
- `pornhub-dl reset` Reschedule all files for download. Useful if you got your hands on a premium account ;)
- `pornhub-dl remove` Remove a user, if it no longer exists
- `pornhub-dl rename` Rename a user, if they chainged their user key

## What does it do

All videos are downloaded into a folder with the name of the respective user.
Pornhub-dl uses youtube-dl as a download backend, but implements own functionality, such as custom user meta-data extraction, user/channel/playlist following, as well as video list extraction and retry logic for rate limiting.

Pornhub-dl crawls all video urls of all followed entities and remembers the ids of downloaded videos.
If you update your database, new videos will be downloaded, while old ones are simply skipped without invoking youtube-dl.

## Configuration

When starting the downloader for the first time, a configuration file is created at `~/.config/pornhub_dl.toml`

- `location`: Video download location. Default: `~/pornhub/`
- `sql_uri`: Your sql location. Default: `'postgres://localhost/pollbot'`

## Premium

To enable premium, copy your Pornhub cookies and paste them to `./cookie_file`.
The cookies file must be formatted after the `Netscape cookie file format`.
The cookie file can be, for instance, created with his tool:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/

On top of that, create a second file `http_cookie_file`
Simply copy the `Cookie` header of any logged in pornhub premium domain request.
Those can be extracted using your browser's network debugging tool.
